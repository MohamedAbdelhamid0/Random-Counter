# Random-Counter
A random 3 bits counter with D flip flops. The project was made on Logisim. Download all files uploaded to ensure that the counter is working correctly. DM me on twitter @0xtkmo if you have any questions.

# Random Sequence
5 ----> 2 ----> 6 ----> 1 ----> 0 ----> 7 ----> 4 ----> 3 ----> Repeat 5 again.


# After Downloading
After you donwnload the 3 files, your folder should look like this.

The seven segment driver was found on the internet I don't know who made it.
The other 2 files were made by me.

# Understanding The Project

This circuit is responsible for getting the desired random sequence. After making the present state, next state, and kmaps, we should the get the circuit above.

Since the counter starts with (5) , we will need the button to "set" the values of D0 {1} and D2 {4} in order to make the first value {5}.
